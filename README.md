# util

Random bash utils, some adapted from other peeps' stuff.

*	git-new-workdir - Modified from git/contrib to work for submodules
*	git-emeld - Editable version of git-meld using git-new-workdir
*	git-fer - Simple git-foreach-repo thing for iterating through super- and sub-modules
*	run-or-raise - Basic implementation (should use other one ??? )

**TODO**: Post links to originals

## Setup

Run

	./install ~/local/bin # Or wherever you want them to go on your $PATH
